# Package Manager Notice

This project uses **Bun** as the primary package manager.

## Quick Setup

bun install
bun dev
```

### If you prefer npm/yarn:
```bash
# Remove the bun.lock file first
rm bun.lock
# or on Windows
del bun.lock

# Then install with your preferred manager
npm install
npm run dev:npm
```

- ðŸ”§ **Built-in** bundler, test runner, and package manager
- ðŸš€ **Better** development experience

## Compatibility
This project works with both Bun and npm/yarn, but Bun is recommended for the best experience.
